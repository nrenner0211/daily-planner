# planner-app

## About

This is a simple daily planner app that color codes your daily tasks so you may organize your time better. It's mobile responsive, and it saves your tasks and updates so you don't miss anything.

This project's purpose was to learn about third-party libraries, such as Bootstrap and jQuery. I also chose to use Moment.js. I overthought it and struggled at first, naturally. But the documentation was straightforward and useful for all three libraries. 10/10 would use again!
